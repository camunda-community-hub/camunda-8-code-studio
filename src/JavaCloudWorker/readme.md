## Java Camunda Platform 8 Worker 
This folder holds all the code for the Java Spring Boot version of the Camunda 8 Worker. As client implementation we have used the spring-zeebe dependency. You can find the GitHub repository right [here](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/spring-zeebe).

In case you want to add this into your project as well just use this dependency in your pom file:
```shell
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.camunda</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-zeebe-starter</artifactId>
  <version>${CURRENT_VERSION}</version>
</dependency>
```

You need to configure properties for Camunda Platform 8 in your resources folder under "application.properties". All necessary information can be retrieved from the Camunda 8 console (Cluster API view) right away. Remember to first of all create a client credential in order to make this possible.
